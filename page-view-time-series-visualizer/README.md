# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** curriculum.  
It analyzes daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum between **May 2016** and **December 2019**, and visualizes the trends through line plots, bar plots, and box plots.

## üìä Project Description

The main steps in the project are:
1. **Data Importing & Cleaning**  
   - Load the dataset from `fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`.  
   - Parse dates and set the `date` column as the index.  
   - Remove outliers by keeping only values between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.
   
2. **Visualization**  
   - **Line Plot**: Shows daily page views over the time period.  
   - **Bar Plot**: Displays monthly average page views for each year.  
   - **Box Plots**:  
     - Year-wise trend visualization  
     - Month-wise seasonality patterns
